feet teeth Etc five on the basis of observable features that is appearance functions Etc the story that I'm going to narrate is called the Gathering in this story you will see so many animals and I'm sure you will be very excited and interested to know about these animals let's begin the story once upon a time there lived a lion who was the king of the jungle One Fine Day a little Cub was born to him and he decided to have a grand party a grand feast and he invited all the animals from all over the world and they were invited to give their blessings to his newborn cup there were many animals who came to this party like the polar bear the penguin the monkey the red-eyed frog the bird ape the elephant the fox and many others the polar bear and the Penguin were meeting the rest of the animals for the first time in their lives they were fascinated by each other's appearances the monkey as usual was jumping from tree to tree was making fun of the polar bear and said to him you are so white and you have such a thick layer of fat and fur foreign I can move so fast and can jump between the trees and you are so slow where do you come from the polar bear replied don't laugh at me my friend I come from the polar region which is covered with snow and it is very very cold for six months the sun doesn't rise there and for the other six months the sun doesn't set don't you think it is very strange my thick white fur protects me from the extreme cold and from predators I have to move slowly and rest often to avoid getting overheated but I am a good swimmer I can remain underwater for long durations my wide and large pores not only help me to swim well but also walk with ease in the snow now look at my friend penguin he can also do the same the monkey and his friends were amazed the polar bear then turned his eyes to the red-eyed frog the beard ape the elephant and said to the monkey dear monkey I have also never seen them in my life can you introduce me to your friends too the monkey replied oh sure of course dear polar bear we come from the tropical rainforests that has a hot and humid climate days and nights are almost equal in length and we get plenty of rainfall we don't have a cold climate like yours then he turned to his friends and said friends say hello to the polar bear and the Penguin the red-eyed frog said hello polar bear Hello Penguin I under red-eyed frog I have sticky pads on my foot that helps me climb trees on where I live the beer rape said and I come from the Western ghats I have a beautiful silver white Mane I am a good climber and I spend a major part of my life on a tree one more thing I love eating fruits the elephant said look at my trunk because of it I have a strong sense of smell and I also use it to pick up my food look at my desk with these I can tear the bark of trees that I love to eat my large ears help me to hear even very soft sounds and to keep me cool in the heat the polar bear said oh my God you are all so outstanding I'm so glad to know you and be your friend thank you Mr lion for your kind hospitality the lion said you're welcome polar bear now look at the story we see so many animals and what does it teach us our Earth has such diverse habitat and all of us adapt so beautifully to it let us all live peacefully and happily and always try to preserve our planet the way it is dear students let's now see what we have learned one polar bears possess the following characteristics a body covered with a thick layer of fat and thick white fur which helps insulate their body from the cold B wide and large pores with webbed toes which specially helps them to adapt for walking on the eyes and swimming in the sea see they move very slowly D all the above statements are true answer d two monkeys are found in a the Mediterranean forests that have dry Summers and rainy Winters be the tropical rainforests that has generally a hot and humid climate see the coniferous forests that have long cold mild and wet Summers D the temperate forests that have mild Summers and Winters answer B three penguins are a good swimmers B they live in temperatures generally higher than 15 degrees Centigrades see they have sticky pads to climb trees D they have long tails for grasping trees answer would be a four the red-eyed frog has sticky pads on their foot that helps a them to swim in deep Waters be them to fight enemies see them do climb trees D them to survive in snow clad mountains answer C 5. the elephant has a strong sense of smell a because of the tusk be because of its long trunk so see because of large ears D because of its thick skin answer B [Music] foreign [Music] [Music]\""

      "The youtube transcript talks about the story of a gathering where many animals from various parts of the world come together and share their unique characteristics. The story is set in different parts of the world, including the polar region, tropical rainforests, and Western ghats. The polar bear and penguin are described as having thick white fur and large pores to help swim well and walk in snow, which is correct. The monkey is described as being found in tropical rainforests, which is also correct. However, the statement that the monkey \"jumps from tree to tree\" implies that it is a species of monkey commonly found in tropical forests, while in reality, monkeys are also found in other habitats, such as coniferous forests, Mediterranean forests, etc. Furthermore, there is no mention of the molecular department and the activities involved in studying weather and climate, which are key points in the textbook content. Therefore, the transcript is somewhat accurate but not entirely relevant to the textbook content, hence a score of 15.\n"
